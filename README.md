Preliminary
===========
Matrix theory has long been useful tools and matrices find applications in almost every scientific feild. Personally, I used it a lot in my research. Advanced matrix applications such as solving differential equations and performing Jacobi relaxation may seem formidable, but they all depend on some fundamental operations, like matrix addition, multiplication, and transposition. 


This Repository
=================

I would like to demonstrates how to implement the basic matrix operations in C++, Java and Python. The purpose is quite straight forward - I would like to study how these languages manipulate objects, 2-D arrays and what their efficiencies and programmabilities are. 



Other Thoughts
==============
I should include some other languages when I have spare time to teach myself Ruby and C#.
